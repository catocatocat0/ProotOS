# Katxe's ProotOS
 
A library for driving protogens using a HUB75 style matrix
Based on PanickingLynx's ProtOpenSource code! Check them out here: https://github.com/PanickingLynx/ProtOpenSource!

## Instructions:
You will need platformio (I recommend VSCode and the Platformio extension) to upload your protogen code
You will also need to download the latest version of Python.

For Windows users, navigate to ProotOS/lib/FacialSprites and then run "install python dependencies.bat". You can then modify the image files inside the folder and run "run convimg.bat" and or "run convgif.bat" to 
convert the images into code. Use the drawFace() function in main.cpp to draw display the images on your HUB75 matrix.
